# Predicting the Survivability of Breast Cancer Patients Using Machine Learning
Female breast cancer is the most prevalent and one of the most lethal cancers in the United States. In this project, we aim to train, compare and evaluate multiple state-of-the-art classification machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, as well as Naive Bayes to predict patients' survivability based on their physical conditions and demographic features. Before model training, we implement several feature selection and extraction techniques including Correlation Heat Map, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Sequential Feature Selection (SFS) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We downloaded an online breast cancer patient dataset of 2509 patients with characteristics recorded in the diagnosis procedure. We also try to explore and analyze the underlying rationales behind the performance of each model. As a result, we found the Randomized Decision Tree (Extra Trees) has the best performance amongst these machine learning models we trained.
